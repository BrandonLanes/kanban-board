## Description

Kanban Board is a web application designed for agile teams to manage tasks and workflows efficiently.

Built with a robust backend and an intuitive user interface, it streamlines task management while maintaining security.

## Features

- Secure login page with JWT-based authentication.
- Task management with Kanban-style ticket organization.
- Automatic redirection to the login page for unauthenticated users.
- Session timeout handling with JWT invalidation.
- Persistent user authentication using local storage.
- Polished, user-friendly interface for agile teams.
